    <main>
        <p> Hello Everyone, my name is Alex Reddy and I am from Massachusetts. 
            Although I recently moved to Kansas City last month, I am in my second to last semester at the University of Missouri. 
            My program of study is the Education Specialist degree with a focus in online education as an online student. 
            Prior to this, I studied at various colleges where I learned about criminal justice, education, and sustainability. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I was not a great student in high school. Instead I come from a background of working in retail, fast-food, law enforcement, non-profit, and finance. 
            I currently work for Oracle as a Learner Leader. When I am not working or engaged as a graduate student, I enjoy talking to my family and occasionally bowling.  
            My limited experience with HTML, comes from using HTML 4 in high school which was challenging. 
            Yet, I look forward to seeing what I can learn about HTML 5 and working alongside all of you. </p>
